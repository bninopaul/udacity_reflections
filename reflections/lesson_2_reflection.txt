What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	git init will tell the system that the directory is already a
repository. This is needed in order to perform different git commands.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	staging area is where you put the files in preparation to wheter you
want to commit the changes. Working directory is just where you change/add
files and prepare them to the staging area. Staging area offers an option to
decide if you want to add the changes to the history of the repository or not.
