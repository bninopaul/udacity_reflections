1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your codes, say for example, you are doing team projects, and you need to share files
to other teamates.


2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

As said in the beginning, GitHub is workplace for teams making a project.
However, if there is a change that you don't want to incorporate in your files
locally, then we can opt not to pull changes.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

forks - if you are within github system
clones - when you want to create an exact copy of repo in local or from github
to local
branches - only applicable in local.

4. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be
easier, and what would be harder?

Without using Git or GitHub, it would be hard to keep track of the changes in
your project because you have to make new file and save your project's version
everytime you made changes and it would be hard to collaborate with your team
mates if you are in group projects  whereas using Git and GitHub would make
life easier,you don't need to make new file/ versions of your projects
manually but you only have to commit changes in order to record the versions
of your project and it is easier to go back to specific version.
