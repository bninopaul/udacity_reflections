1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your codes, say for example, you are doing team projects, and you need to share files
to other teamates.


2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

As said in the beginning, GitHub is workplace for teams making a project.
However, if there is a change that you don't want to incorporate in your files
locally, then we can opt not to pull changes.
